Project overview
- goal:
	1. create a multilingual(English/Spanish) ipad-viewable(optimized) survey(questionnaire) web application with input validation logics
	2. deploy to firewall-enforced / SSL-protected servers
- choices for development
	No redcap (due to lack of multilingual support & not-flexible validation logics)
	Java/Groovy/Grails is the main programming language (Also Javascript is used for client-side validation)
	Postgres DB is used (mainly because it can support really long list of columns per table - for now 
- members: 1 developer/server administrator(Soo), 1 qa/test (Rodrigo), PI(Tresita), PMs(David & Steven)
- milestons:
	started Nov(Dev)-2010
	released English only Dec-2010
	release Spanish-version Jan-2011
	reviewed (for security) Jan-2011
	deployed to PSM Feb(Mar)-2011 (CER meta data are prepared by Scott & Rodrigo) - not practical / need to re-configure port number and URL
	deployed to Firewall-enforced Moffitt servers(DB/Web) - on going
	release with IRB-approved Questions (renumbered Q numbers) Mar-2011	
- final release: scheduled 4/11/2011

Assumptions
- Subject(or surveyee) is not the operator of surveying device (i.e. ipad or web browswer).
- Surveyer(s) is the only valid user and operator to create a survey / edit only during the certain period of time
- Assited by the application's validation logics, Surveyer will be responsible for correctness of the entered data by him/her.
- Admin will verify the 'completed' surveys if it's really completed or valid using automatic validation/verification program logics and his/her own knowledge (e.e.g too young to get certain type of cancer)

Use cases
(Surveyer role)
- After login, there's two options: create a survey & list surveys (he/she has done)
- Can edit the ongoing(not completed) survey before done(lock)
(Admin role)
- Not able to create survey (only Administer/Verify)
- Ater login, can see all the completed & uncompleted survey list
- Can edit completed survey only with reasonable

Exception handling
(Network failure during survey)
- Natively, the entered data until previous step(or page) will be saved
- If disconnected, most likely, entered data in current step would be lost
- Exception field will be provided for marking it's the duplicate survey since the previous one are lost by some unexpected reason(cannot complete ???)

Further developments (more feedback/comments are needed for execution)
- Export (CSV or other format) feature will be provide as separate application (two reasons - renamed variables does not match to the original questions / protection to original data)
- More validations (other than age, DOB, max length of string, max number of digits)
- Re-Deployments to PSM with practical/secure way
- Make the Moffit servers working properly
